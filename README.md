# Phase API Helper

The vision is to have an integrarted extension with VS Code that makes developing Phaser JS games easier.

## Components:

- Side bar: Allows for quick searching of the Phaser API docs without leaving VS Code
- Context help: Highlighting and clicking into a method/class/namespace returns context information about the code.
